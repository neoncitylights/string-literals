# Introduction to Markdown and mdBook

Welcome to your documentation site! This site is built using:

- **Markdown**: a lightweight markup language for formatting plaintext.
- **mdBook**: a static site generator for Markdown files, created by Rust.

In this repository, you'll see these files:

```txt
src/
├── README.md
├── SUMMARY.md
└── chapter-1.md
```

- `README.md`: This file is the introduction to your book.
- `SUMMARY.md`: This file lists all the chapters in your books. You can have sub-chapters using sub-bullets.
- `chapter-1.md`: This is an example Markdown file.
