# Chapter 1

We then sought for Alexander, but were unable to find him. One of his neighbors, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten and eleven o'clock last night. We were at a standstill again.

Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of Alexander had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the women crying out "This is the work of a Slovak!" We hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.

Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!

You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! It's a T. It goes "tuh". And until then, I can never die? Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?

## $\KaTeX$ Example

The below formula is the definition of a Fourier transform (FT) in $\KaTeX$.

Given the input:

```tex
\stackrel{\wedge}{f}(\xi) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} f(x)e^{2\pi ix\xi}dx, \forall\xi\in\Reals
```

Will output:
$$
\stackrel{\wedge}{f}(\xi) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} f(x)e^{2\pi ix\xi}dx, \forall\xi\in\Reals
$$
